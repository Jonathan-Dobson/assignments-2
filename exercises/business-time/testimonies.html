        <p>.........."I can hardly contain myself here to tell you how much Young Living essential oils have changed my life.  I suffered from anxiety and had a really hard time sleeping.  Insomnia took over my life and I felt like a zombie most of the time.  Then a friend came along and introduced me to Young Living's essential oils.  She educated me about what oils would help my problem.  She oiled me up and I went home and had the best sleep I had had in a very long time.  Using the oils that support sleep has changed my health and my life.       Thank you so much <span class="young">Young Living</span>!!"

        <p>"When I say that YL has changed my life...it truly has!!! "40" is the magic age for cardiovascular issues in my family. (2 aunts and an uncle ðŸ˜²) Just learning more and being able to not only educate myself.....but also my doctor's has been such a comfort. (As many know our medical options around here for specialist are not stacked in our favor ...)

        I turn 38 this year, I am hopeful that with all the time and energy I'm investing in learning more will not only help me....but others that I know and love.(or even meet along the way!)
                
        I CAN'T possibly express the importance of Super B and the support that it brings to my family who have been affected by this mutation.
                
        Does anyone else finally feel hope after years of feeling lost in how to care for yourself......
