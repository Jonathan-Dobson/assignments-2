        <h1>Elaine Yada Yada's Over The Best Part</h1>
        <p>Let’s kick things off with an absolute classic! In <span>“The Yada Yada”</span> (Season 8, episode 19), George's new girlfriend, Marcy, likes to gloss over parts of stories by saying, <span>"yada yada yada."</span> At first, everything's fine — George even borrows Marcy's habit in order to skip over the bizarre details of his former fiancé Susan's death. But then Marcy throws George a major curveball...she yada yada yada's sex: "So, speaking of exes, my old boyfriend came over late last night, and yada yada yada, anyway, I'm really tired today." A truly unforgettable moment in Seinfeld history.</p>

        <h1>Low Talker</h1>
        <p>In <span>"The Puffy Shirt"</span> (Season 5, episode 2), Kramer's new clothing designer girlfriend, Leslie, is a low talker — she speaks so quietly, she can barely be understood by those around her. Actually, during a dinner with Jerry and Elaine, Kramer seems to be the only person who can understand Leslie at all! Leslie's status as a low talker gets Jerry into a rather unfortunate situation...

        <h1>But I don't wanna be a pirate</h1>
        <p>Also in <span>"The Puffy Shirt</span>," because Jerry can't hear Leslie, he just decides to smile and nod at everything she mumbles. In doing so, he unknowingly agrees to wear Leslie's latest fashion creation — "the puffy shirt" — during his upcoming appearance on The Today Show. When Kramer delivers the tragic-looking shirt to Jerry's apartment, Jerry utters one of the episode's best lines...
